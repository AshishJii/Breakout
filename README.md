# Breakout
First time using github for a project.
This is a simple BLOCK BREAKER game which you must have already played thousands of time in your keypad mobiles. Those were the days...
Just a fun project to enhance my skills.
Made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Uses Firebase DB to record and fetch High Scores.
The project is live at : https://github.com/AshishJii/Breakout
