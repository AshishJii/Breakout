# Breakout
Well, this is the first time i am using github for a project. 
It has suggested me to write a README file for it but i dont know what what to write in it.
I think i should give a speech.
Good afternoon, Respected people , animals and all my dear Aliens. i am here today ............
NO . just skip it.

OK
this is a simple BLOCK BREAKER game which you must have already played thousands of time in your keypad mobiles. Those were the days.
Just a fun project to enhance my skills.
