# Breakout
Well, this is the first time i am using github for a project. 
It has suggested me to write a README file for it but i dont know what what to write in it.
I think i should give a speech.
Good afternoon, Respected people , animals and all my dear Aliens. i am here today ............
NO . just skip it.

OK
this is a simple BLOCK BREAKER game which you must have already played thousands of time in your keypad mobiles. Those were the days.
Ball direction can be changed by paddle.

In upcoming days, i think i will add multi hit blocks and other powerups.
I think that's enough.
