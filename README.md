# Breakout
First time using github for a project.<br>
This is a simple BLOCK BREAKER game which you must have already played thousands of time in your keypad mobiles. Those were the days...<br>
Just a fun project to enhance my skills.<br>
Made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Uses Firebase DB to record and fetch High Scores.<br>
The project is live [here](https://ashishjii.github.io/Breakout/)
